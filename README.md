## Description

Given the fact that a person has at least 7 different accounts he or she has signed into, be it email, social media, entertainment or job portal accounts. It becomes really hard to remember all those passwords and even create new ones.

With this application one is able to create a user account in the password locker account and use this account to now create other account details together with their credentials therefore reducing the need to master the various passwords and details.

With password locker a user can do the following:

<ul>
<li>Create an account or sign up to password locker</li>
<li>Login to password locker and now start creating other accounts with their relevant details.</li>
<li>With the accounts you can view all your accounts and their details, delete the accounts and display every account with its details</li>

</ul>
